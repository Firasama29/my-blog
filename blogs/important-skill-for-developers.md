# The Most Important Skill as a Developer
Contrary to popular belief, software developers don't write code for the majority of their time; instead, they dedicate 80% of their time to solving problems, seeking optimal ways to write code or finding the best library or framework for their projects. Coding is simply the means to apply their findings.

Problem-solving is one, if not the most important skill for a software developer. This is because problems are a fundamental aspect of software development and you may encounter them on a daily basis. They are unpredictable and can range from simple syntax errors to runtime exceptions. Hence, it is essential to focus on enhancing this skill in order to excel as a software developer.

Here are some tips on how to improve problem-solving skill:

## Identify the problem
Let's say you encounter an issue at work. For instance, a tester reports a bug. To solve a problem, you first need to identify and understand the problem. Here are some ways to do that:
1. #### Ask the right questions
   The key to understanding the issue depends on many factors, among them is knowing what to ask. Half the solution lies in asking the right question because it can guide you to the path of the solution and connect you with the right people and the right tools. Each question contributes to a part of the answer and when you piece all these parts together, you may find yourself with the solution.

**Now the question is, how do you determine the right questions to ask?**

Well, the first step is to seek a clear description of the problem. Once you do that, you would need to identify the potential root causes and effects. Make sure you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of the programming language and relevant domain to effectively tackle the issue.

2. #### Ask the right people
   Knowing who to ask is just as important as the questions themselves because it can save you a lot of time and effort. Identify the key players concerned with the problem. Reach out to the client or business team to clarify the desired outcome, or connect with a peer from the development team to understand the current system behavior. Ask them the questions you've prepared then summarize and discuss the findings with them to ensure you're all on the same page.

## Use the right tools
The effective use of search tools is another crucial method for finding solutions. As a software developer, you have access to a variety of useful tools, including:
- google

- StackOverFlow, where you'll likely come across an issue that has already been faced and addressed by another developer on the platform

- And of course, AI chatbots like ChatGPT, which make searching even easier in the form of conversation.

It's essential to leverage more than one search tool, especially when it comes to ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots. This is because AI tools, as of the date of writing this article, may "hallucinate", meaning, they tend to produce incorrect response from time to time, therefore, it's risky to blindly rely on them for the time being.

## Test your solution
It's important to validate the proposed solution before presenting it to seniors. This step serves as quality assurance to ensure the quality and reliability of the solution while confirming that it behaves as expected. Furthermore, this process helps uncover any potential bugs or errors beforehand rather than discovering them later in production environment.

## Seek peer review
Peer review involves presenting your solution to colleagues for their evaluation and feedback. here's why this step is so valuable:
It provides different perspectives on aspects that you might have overlooked

- It serves as an additional layer of quality assurance

- It validates the effectiveness of your solution

- It enables knowledge sharing and exchange of ideas among team members

- It gives you the opportunity to learn from the variety of insights and feedback

By iterating through the above steps every time you encounter a bug or undesired system behavior, you'll gradually develop this valuable skill of critical thinking and problem-solving.

> **Tip**
>> I would lastly add one more word of advice to keep in mind:

>> - Problem-solving is not a destination, it's a process of ongoing improvement that even the most seasoned developers consistently pursue.

>> - This is a positive thing considering that software development is a landscape filled with unpredictable challenges. Embrace it as an opportunity for growth and continuous learning.

>> - Your ability to navigate this landscape with the appropriate mindset will not only make you stand out as an effective developer, but also contribute to your long-term success.
